# Virtual-House-Tour-Model-Unity-HDRP
Here's my first virtual tour house that I made in Unity using HDRP as template,  and is also my first arquitecture project and the imagens renders was made in Blender.  It's a very simple virtual house tour with no sound, just use the W/S and A/D to move, you can quit aplication just clicking in ESC and the doors open automatic when you get close. 

This is the codes for doors and first person view for arquitecture, link the door code in the doors with proper pivot point location and the another one in player object 
with the main camera as parent object from player
